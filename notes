Add bitboard functions:
    Bitscan (returns index of bit)
    Attack masks for move gen

    switch(board_type)
    {
        case Pawn:
            Generate pawn_attack_mask
        case Rook:
            Generate rook_attack_mask
        case etc:
            Generate etc_attack_mask
    }

    and with enemy pieces and iterate through results
    use bit-scanning to determine index and make move_t

Change move struct:
    One uint8_t for index, rather than two for rank and file
    Edit functions accordingly
